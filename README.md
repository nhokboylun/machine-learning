## I. Introduction
This report provides an in-depth explanation of the machine learning algorithms implemented for classification and missing value estimation in Python. The methods are tailored to handle specific challenges presented by various datasets.

## II. Installation Guide
### Step 1: Installing Visual Studio
Download Visual Studio from the official Microsoft website.
Run the installer and select the 'Python development' workload during installation.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
### Step 2: Installing Python
Download Python from the official Python website.
Run the Python installer. Make sure to check the option 'Add Python to PATH' before clicking 'Install Now'.
Follow the installer's instructions to complete the installation.
### Step 3: Setting Up My Project
Clone or download my project's repository to your local machine.
Open Visual Studio, and from the 'File' menu, choose 'Open -> Project/Solution', and navigate to your project folder.
Open the folder as a project in Visual Studio.
### Step 4: Installing Dependencies
To run the project successfully, you need to install several Python libraries that the project depends on. Follow these steps to install all the necessary libraries:  
- Open a terminal in Visual Studio (usually at the bottom of the IDE).  
- Ensure you are in your projectâ€™s root directory. 
- Run the following command to install the required libraries:
  #### pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
  
This command installs:  
- pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.    
- numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.  
- scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python.
### Step 5: Running the Code
- In Visual Studio, navigate to the main.py to run.  
- Select run python file on the top-right.  
- Visual Studio will execute your Python script, and you can view the output in the terminal window.
